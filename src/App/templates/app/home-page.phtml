<p>People who made powers of attorney from April 2013 to March 2017 are entitled to a partial refund 
of any application fees paid.</p>

<p>To claim a refund, you must be either:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>the donor - the person who made the powers of attorney</li>
    <li>an attorney - appointed by the donor and claiming on their behalf</li> 
</ul>

<p>The refund is for the donor, even if someone else paid the fees at the time.</p>

<div class="panel panel-border-wide">
    <p>Make one claim per donor even if you made more than one power of attorney or 
    paid repeat fees. Records will be checked for all fees paid.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading-medium">What you'll need</h2>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>About 10 minutes to complete the claim</li>
    <li>Donor's UK bank account number and sort code</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/terms#bank-details">How we keep your information safe</a>.</p>

<p>You don't need the power of attorney documents with you but it might be helpful.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">How much you'll get</h2>

<?php $this->insert('snippet::refund-amounts');?>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Types of power of attorney</h2>

<p>Refunds apply to:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>lasting powers of attorney (LPAs) for financial affairs, and for health and welfare</li>
    <li>enduring powers of attorney (EPAs) - an earlier type of power of attorney</li>
</ul>

<p>All eligible fees for a donor will be refunded in one go - so you only need to make a single 
refund claim, even if you made an EPA and an LPA, for example.</P> 

<h2 class="heading-medium">Why refunds are available</h2>
<p>The Office of the Public Guardian recently reduced power of attorney registration
    fees to better reflect processing costs.</p>
<p>As people who paid fees from April 2013 to March 2017 were charged more than 
    the processing costs they can now claim a partial refund.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">If the donor doesnâ€™t have a UK bank account</h2>
<p>Contact the Helpline to find out how to get a refund if the donor doesn't have a UK bank account.</p>
   
<h2 class="heading-medium">If the donor has died</h2>
<p>Contact the Helpline if the donor has died. They will discuss your situation and let you know 
who is entitled to claim the refund.</p>

    <p>It takes up to 12 weeks for a refund to be processed.</p>
