<h2 class="heading-medium">Who can claim</h2>

<p>You must be either:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>the 'donor' - the person who made the LPA or EPA</li>
    <li>an 'attorney' - trusted by the donor and claiming on their behalf</li>
</ul>

<p>You can claim for all of a donor's fees in one go. For example, if they made 2 LPAs or paid twice because of a mistake.</p>

 <div class="panel panel-border-wide">
    <p>
    If the donor has died a refund can only be claimed if their estate is in probate. Contact the <a href="#helpline">Refunds Helpline</a>.
    </p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading-medium">What you'll need</h2>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>donor's name, date of birth and postcode</li>
    <li>donor's bank account details - refunds can only be paid to the donor</li>
    <li>10 minutes to complete your claim</li>
</ul>

<p>It can take up to 12 weeks for a refund to be processed.</p>
