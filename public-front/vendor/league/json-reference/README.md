Most JSON schemas use JSON references to minimize duplication. A JSON reference is an object that looks like {"$ref": "http://some/where"} and points to a JSON object somewhere else.

JSON Reference is a library for resolving references.

- Resolves all references, replacing them with proxy objects.
- Supports references to external files, urls, or custom sources.
- Safely resolves circular references.
- Supports caching dereferenced schemas.
- Dereferenced schemas can be safely json_encoded.
- Works with Swagger, JSON Schema, and any other spec compliant JSON documents.
