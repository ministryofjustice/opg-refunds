### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#10](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-migration/pull/10)
  fixes a scenario whereby the RC4 skeleton would be selected over the stable
  one as the basis for the bootstrap files.

- [#12](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-migration/pull/12)
  modifies how zend-diactoros is added to the root package. Instead of an
  additional `composer require` statement fired early, it is added to the
  package requirements, and the package requirements are now installed before any
  development requirements to ensure the PSR-7 implementation is discovered.

## 0.1.2 - 2018-03-15

- Nothing.

### Changed

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Fixes an issue that occurs when running in an application that does not
  require zend-diactoros in the package root. The tool now explicitly requires it
  before doing any other migrations.

- Adds a default directory in which to convert middleware to request handlers.

- Adds logic to remove the tool package itself during migration, ensuring it is
  not present in the final artifacts.
